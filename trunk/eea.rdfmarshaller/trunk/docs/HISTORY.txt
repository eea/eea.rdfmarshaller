5.3 - (2013-01-15)
------------------

  of a folderish content. Keep only hasPart statements.
  This is to avoid redundancy and speed-up rdf export of large folderish content.

------------------
* Change: registered OWL namespace globally as it is often needed.

* Bug fix: also register the geo namespace, for pretty printing
  [tiberich refs #3425]
* Refactor: improve the API to make it more clear about the intent of classes
  and interfaces. Now we no longer assume that all exported objects are archetypes,
  we have a more pluggable way to override, per field_type + fieldname +
  context_type the output. Also make the value extracting logic a bit easier to
  follow by having adapters for each type of value (list, string, datetime,
  etc).
